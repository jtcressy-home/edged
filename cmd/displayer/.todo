This will be the entrypoint for the edged program that manages
  display outputs on edge devices

The program should target two display methods:
- tty w/ TUI
  - This should be the default and always-on method as it just uses stdout
  - systemd unit is configured to hijack tty1 on edge device's system
  - tailscale QR code and runtime info should be displayed when appropriate
- i2c OLED
  - same as above but only enabled when device is detected
