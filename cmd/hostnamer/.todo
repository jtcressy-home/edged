This will be the entrypoint for the edged program that
 configures hostnames via systemd hostnamectl.

The program should fork into each of these scenarios:
- if: device is raspberry pi
  - generate hostname from cpu serial
- device has SMBIOS to use against dmidecode
  - generate hostname from board info and serial
- device is neither RPi or has SMBIOS
  - fail and don't update hostname
